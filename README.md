# 🎞️ Minimal Loop Gallery

A minimalist web gallery showcasing looping animations created while learning Blender. Built using Vue, the gallery provides:

- 🖼️ Thumbnail previews of each animation loop
- 🎥 Scene overview for each loop (concept, layout, technique)
- 📁 Downloadable .mp4 files

## 🧰 Technologies

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (for creating loops)
- Minimal CSS

## 📌 Purpose

This gallery was built as a creative exercise to document my progress in Blender. All loops are original and kept simple, focusing on learning motion, lighting, and materials.

## ✨ Live Demo

You can view the gallery locally or via GitHub Pages.
